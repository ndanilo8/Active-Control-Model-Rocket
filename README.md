# Application of Active Stabilization on Experimental Academic Rockets

In Essence, TVC like the name sujects, it stands for Thurst Vectoring Control. This consists of gimbaling the nozzle (In this case the Motor). This induces a Torque or a "Moment" around the CM of the rocket, thus making the rocket "steer". Like the following animation:

### DISCLAMER
The goal of this project is to gain experience in real life development of eletronically stabilized Experimental Sounding Rockets for **educational purposes ONLY**.
With this said, **I WILL NOT** be disclosing any flight software in this repository or anywhere else.

You will be able to follow along the project here as I will be posting simulations screenshots, photos, videos.
Sharing ONLY what is currently legally found elsewhere on the model rocketry community.
