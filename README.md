# GNC-model-rocket
Guidance Navegation and Control, GNC for sort, Model Rocket.

This project will be first a proof of concept. So the main objective is improving the know-how of an Advanced Model Rocket build from "ground up" to "sky high".

The payload of this said Rocket will be the Avionics hosting the Teensy 4.1 powered Flight Computer.
This will Control the TVC Engine Mount to "steer" the Rocket but always keeping the pointy end up :)

In Essence, TVC like the name sujects, it is Thurst Vectoring Control. This consists of gimbaling the Motor's Thurst Vector Direction 
making it rotate by the CM of the rocket therefore changing it's overall trajectory of the flight.
