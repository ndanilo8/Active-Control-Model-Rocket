# GNC-model-rocket
Guidance Navigation and Control, GNC for sort, Model Rocket.

This project will be first a proof of concept with 2 parts:
1 - Flight with fins (passive control)
2 - Flight with only TVC (active control)

This test profile will allow to have some good telemetry regarding how the forces are acting on the rocket to therefore fine tune/fix ASTRA's software for the second flight with only TVC.

The payload of this said Rocket will be the Avionics hosting the Teensy 4.1 powered Flight Computer called ASTRA.
This will Control the TVC Engine Mount to "steer" the Rocket but always keeping the pointy end UP :)

In Essence, TVC like the name sujects, it stands for Thurst Vectoring Control. This consists of gimbaling the Motor's Thurst Vector which applies torque on the rocket and therefore changes it's overall trajectory.


## DISCLAMER
The goal of this project is to gain experience in real life small-scale development of eletronically controlled model rockets for **educational purposes ONLY**.
With this said, **I WILL NOT** be disclosing ASTRA's software in this repository or anywhere else.

You will be able to follow along the project here as I will be posting simulations screenshots, photos, videos and hardware subsystems development, overall engineering.
Sharing ONLY what is currently legally found elsewhere on the model rocketry community.
