Guidance Navigation and Control, GNC for sort, Model Rocket.

In Essence, TVC like the name sujects, it stands for Thurst Vectoring Control. This consists of gimbaling the Motor. This induces a Torque or a "Moment" around the CM of the rocket, thus making the rocket "steer". Like the following simulation:

### DISCLAMER
The goal of this project is to gain experience in real life small-scale development of eletronically stabilized  model rockets for **educational purposes ONLY**.
With this said, **I WILL NOT** be disclosing any flight software in this repository or anywhere else.

You will be able to follow along the project here as I will be posting simulations screenshots, photos, videos.
Sharing ONLY what is currently legally found elsewhere on the model rocketry community.
